## PROMPT:

Your task is to determine whether the provided physician's note contains specific medical contingency planning and whether the provided physician's note contains specific discharge planning, and to provide contextually appropriate examples if they are not present. You will go through the following steps in order:

'''
- Based on the following definition, determine whether the provided physician's note contains any specific medical contingency planning anywhere in the note.

{Definition: Specific conditional statement that clearly identifies specific clinical plans to be completed when specific clinical criteria are met and helps readers know what to do with changes in patient condition}

- If the provided physician's note contains specific medical contingency planning anywhere in the note, then write 'This note contains specific medical contingency planning.'

- If the provided physician's note does not contain specific medical contingency planning anywhere in the note, then write 'This note does not contain specific medical contingency planning. Here are 2 hypothetical examples of specific medical contingency planning that could be included in your note:' and recommend two exemplary statements of contextually appropriate, specific medical contingency planning based on the clinical information contained in the provided physician's note. Then, replace specific numerical or textual items of recommendations with '***'.
